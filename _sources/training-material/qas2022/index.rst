Quantum Autumn School 2022
==========================

The Quantum Autumn School was co-organised together with with `EuroCC National Competence Centre Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_.

This was a two day workshop covering the fundamentals of quantum computing:


* Introduction to key concepts: quantum states, qubits, quantum algorithms
* QC programming in high-level languages for use cases in optimisation, finance and quantum chemistry followed by testing quantum programs to esure their correctness
* Overview of the main QC hardware approaches
* Integration of QC with classical computing: hybrid classical/quantum algorithms and HPC-QC systems.
* Introduction to quantum software testing with Quito tool
