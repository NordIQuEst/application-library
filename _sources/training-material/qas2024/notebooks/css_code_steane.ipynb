    "Since we have to protect our quantum state from Pauli-$X$ and Pauli-$Z$ errors, CSS codes combine two classical linear codes $C_1$ and $C_2$. The respective parity check matrices $H_1$ and $H_2$ define the $X$ and $Z$ stabilizers. To emphasize this fact, we'll denote the matrices as $H_X$ and $H_Z$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since all stabilizers from the same parity check matrix necessarily commute, we need to make sure that rows from $H_X$ and $H_Z$ commute. This is ensured if the number of qubits targeted by both stabilizer types is even for each possible pair of stabilizers.\n",

    "**Efficient Encoding of Pauli Strings in Software:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stim is designed to allow the simulation of very large stabilizer codes, so an efficient representation on a computer is crucial.\n",
    "There are 4 different single-qubit Pauli operators, so 2 bits are required to represent them. Stim uses the following encoding:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first bit indicates the presence of an $X$ operation, while the second bit indicates a $Z$ operation. The $Y$ operator, can be decomposed into $X \\cdot Z$ and has therefore both bits set to 1.\n",

    "This enables multiplication of Pauli operators through simple bitwise operations. For two Pauli operators $A$ and $B$, their product (up to a global phase) is computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$enc(A \\cdot B) = enc(A) \\oplus enc(B)$$\n",
