    "\n",
    "VQE is the most commonly used algorithm to obtain the ground state energy of molecules due to lower requirements in the coherence times of the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the theory chapter it combines the quantum and classical processes. Specifically, it will use the QPU to measure the expectation value of the Molecular Hamiltonian ($\\langle \\Psi | H | \\Psi \\rangle$) and a classical optimization method to vary the parameters of the Wavefunction (commonly used optimizers are SLSQP or SPSA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how do we obtain the Ground State Energy of H2 using Qiskit."
