    "## 0. Reminder - what is a European call option?\n",
    "\n",
    "A call option is a financial contract in which the holder (buyer) has the right (but not the obligation) to buy a specified quantity of a security at a specified price (strike price) within a fixed period of time (until its expiration/maturity). For a European call option the holder can only exercise the option at expiry/maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the writer (seller) of a call option, it represents an obligation to sell the underlying security at the strike price if the option is exercised. The call option writer is paid a premium for taking on the risk associated with the obligation (this is however omitted here as it only offsets the payoff by the premium price).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a European call option with strike price $K$ and and underlying asset whose spot price at maturity $S_T$ follows a given distribution, then the corresponding payoff function for the holder is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi(S_T) = \\max(S_T - K, 0).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For an investor to profit from a European call option, the spot price at maturity $S_T$ has to be high enough above the strike price to cover the cost of the option premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple example\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that Bob is the writer for a European call option with [IonQ](https://www.avanza.se/aktier/om-aktien.html/1284389/ionq) (NYSE: IONQ) as the underlying with spot price $S_0=€30$. The contract has maturity time $T$ of 30 days from today, strike price $K=€35$, with a premium of $€5$ per contract. In this simple example we disregard all brokerage and assume that Bob does not already own the underlying asset (referred to as a naked call option).\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this premium too high? Is it too low? Is it perhaps a fair price? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is interested in buying this call option but is unsure whether Bob has a fair premium on the contract. However, Alice strongly believes that IonQ will be trading for $€50$ in 30 days (i.e. at maturity $T$). Fast forward 30 days and in this case Alices' beliefs turned out to be true, thus she will make $S_T - K - \\text{premium} = 50 - 35 - 5 = €10$ per contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "If IonQ would be worth less than the strike price $K$ at maturity $T$ then the option is not exercised and expires worthless. The holder (Alice) loses the premium and the writer (Bob) profits on the premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would Bob want to write this specific call option? Based on the strike price $K=€35$ and the premium $€5$ we know that Bob makes money if IonQ is trading for less than $€40$ at maturity ($\\text{premium} -(S_T - K) = 5 - (40 - 35)$). If $S_T=€38$ then Bob makes $5 - (38 -35) = €2$ per contract. So Bob would only really want to write this call option because he believes that IonQ will not be worth much more in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple case above Alice accepted the premium (the price of the option) based solely on her strong belief that IonQ would be worth much more in the future. But could she in some way have made a better decision on whether or not the premium of the call option was fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, she herself could have estimated a fair price of the call option based on e.g. the current spot price $S_t$, the desired strike price $K$, the time to maturity $T$, the risk-free rate $r$, the assets implied volatility $\\sigma$ by, and a prediction on the value of the underlying at maturity, by estimating the discounted expected payoff\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = e^{-rT}\\mathbb{E}[\\phi(S_T)] = e^{-rT}\\mathbb{E}[\\max(S_T - K, 0)].\n",
    "$$\n",
