Quantum Autumn School 2024
==========================

The Quantum Autumn School was co-organised together with `EuroCC National Competence Centre Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_.

The event saw researchers and members of industry take part in a 3-day hybrid event held in Stockholm, Sweden.
The participants were given an introduction to quantum computing and a look at the possible applications for quantum computers,
as well as the opportunity to use real quantum computers of the NordIQuEst collaboration.
