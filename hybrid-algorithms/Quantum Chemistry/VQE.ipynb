    "# Finding the Ground State Energy of Molecular Hydrogen (H2) via the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).\n",

    "As explained in the theory chapter it combines the quantum and classical processes. Specifically, it will use the QPU to measure the expectation value of the Molecular Hamiltonian ($\\langle \\Psi | H | \\Psi \\rangle$) and a classical optimization method to vary the parameters of the Wavefunction (commonly used optimizers are SLSQP or SPSA).\n",
